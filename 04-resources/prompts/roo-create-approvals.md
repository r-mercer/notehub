# Roo Approvals

## First Crack

``` PlainText
Using the best principals, practices and following the schemas outlined in @/docs/docs/architecture , please create a module (schema outlined in @/docs/docs/architecture/schemas/| Column1modules.md ) for handling administrative approvals. 


Ensure that the output is strictly following the .json requirements and schemas set out in @/docs/docs/architecture/schemas .

Ensure that the Module is composed of:
- Cards @/docs/docs/architecture/components/Cards.md
- and follows all best practices requirements discussed in the documentation.

Ensure that appropriate provisioning is made for any required Actions or Flows that will be needed to both assign approvals and complete approvals.

You should follow the RBAC rules: GlobalAdmin, Approver and Educator (default)

If you believe that there is a component or API call missing that will require non-.json code to be written, please spell that out in full.

If you do not know where documentation is to be found, please ask.```
