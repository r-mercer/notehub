# Roo Quiz

## First Crack

``` PlainText

You are to gather requirements and understand the design principals of this application. Reference @docs/docs/architecture to understand how the exisitng application is configured. Note that the configuration files are stored in a FerretDB kubernetes cluster running locally. 

Once you have done this, you are to create a list of suggested steps to implement a new module. This module should be a Quiz App. To implement this you will need to implement:
- A new schema @/docs/docs/architecture/components/Schemas.md
- A new module @/docs/docs/architecture/components/Modules.md
- A new card @/docs/docs/architecture/components/Cards.md
- As well as the required Actions and Flows to assign and grade quiz results.

Ensure that you have followed the requirements and exisiting methodology as defined in the .json schemas set out in @/docs/docs/architecture/schemas .

Ensure that appropriate provisioning is made for any required Actions or Flows that will be needed to both assign approvals and complete approvals.

You should be able to complete this without needing to create additional API Controller methods.

If you do not know where documentation is to be found, please ask.
